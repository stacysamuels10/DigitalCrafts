# Loops
#loops are used to go through a specific amount of times
#and execute code every time it goes through it

# it iterates over something

# it iterates over lists

# it can iterate over dictionaries

# it can call something a bunch of times

# to cancel out of a continual loop cntrl c

# while loop does something WHILE this is true

# while (condition to eval): 

num = 0
while 2 > num:
    print("Yay")
    num+=1 #same as num = num + 1

# Condition can be checked many times
# need to have something for a while loop to stop with

data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
students = []
num = 0
print(len(data))
while num < len(data):
    print(data[num])
    num+=1

fruit = ["a", "b", "c"]
# for is the main way to navigate lists
# for singular in list

for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
