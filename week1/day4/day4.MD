# Functions and why we use them

- Functions are things we create to do steps that we often repeat
- If you find yourself writing the same code over and over again, its probably prime for a function
- Functions allow us to do multiple steps over and over but only writing the code once

- order of if statements is important, you can have a bunch of if statements as long as they are in the correct order
- return statements will end the function

1.

4.

# Dictionary

### Dictionaries will give you the value of something by referencing its key

- you can iterate over dictionaries similar to lists
- can add and change things in the dictionary
  '''
  variable = {
  "nums" [1,2,3,4,5],
  "name": "Joe",
  "boolean": False,
  "pets": "crazy cats"
  }
  print(variable["nums"]) #this only prints the list "nums", always brackets and " " to access pieces inside dictionary

for num in variable["nums"]
print(num)

```

```
