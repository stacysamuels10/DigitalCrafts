# classes and how to use them

dictionary

```
user = {
    "name": "Rahmin"
}
print(user["name"])
//Rahmin
user["name"] = "Amanda"
print(user["name"])

//class

rahmin = new Person()
rahmin.speak()
// "what's up"
amanda = new Person()
amanda.speak()
//"Hello"
```

This is the barebones you need to define a class, this is pretty useless

```
class user:
    pass
```

we want to define a class wiht a constructor and then add specific things that help us with our program

the constructor is the blueprint of this class only
the skeleton of that class and only that class

`rahmin.name` this is called dot notation, used to call objects

`__init__` is initializing the variables in the class, built in function to create a class ** function ** make it a very clear and different function

python devs have agreed to self instatiating the class.

## classes can be used a characters in the game
