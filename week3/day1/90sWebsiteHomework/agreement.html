        Web Site Hosting Service Agreement Updated December 30, 2002 The
        following agreement is between Technical Advisors, Inc. (“TACO”) of 14
        Cornell Avenue, Monroe Township, NJ 08831-8575 and You (“Client”)
        WHEREAS, TACO is an Internet Service Provider offering storage and
        transfer of documents and other information over the Internet;
      </p>
      <p>WHEREAS, Client seeks to use these servers for its own purposes;</p>
      <p>
        WHEREAS, the parties acknowledge that the Internet is neither owned nor
        controlled by any one entity; therefore, TACO can make no guarantee that
        any given party shall be able to access the server made available by
        TACO at any given time. TACO represents that it shall make every good
        faith effort to ensure that the server is available as widely as
        possible and with as little service interruption as possible;
      </p>
      <p>
        NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises contained herein,
        the parties agree as follows;
      </p>
      <ol type="I">
        <li>
          <b><h2>Financial Arrangements:</h2></b>
        </li>
        <ol>
          <li><h4 style="margin: 0">Length of service</h4></li>
          <p style="margin-top: 0">
            Client agrees to an initial three (3) month or six (6) month
            contractual term of service (“Term”). The length of contract
            required is based on the type of service desired by the Client and
            shall be determined solely by TACO.
          </p>
          <li><h4 style="margin: 0">Service start date</h4></li>
          <p style="margin-top: 0">
            The first payment plus setup charges, if any, shall be due in
            advance of any service provided. Service shall begin upon TACO's
            receipt of payment for such first Term of service or upon a mutually
            agreed upon other date.
          </p>
          <li><h4 style="margin: 0">Renewal by client</h4></li>
          <p style="margin-top: 0">
            This agreement will automatically renew for successive three (3) or
            six (6) month Terms unless canceled in writing by Client at least 30
            days prior to the end of Term renewal date. Renewal prices are
            subject to change. Renewal of services by Client indicates agreement
            to any Contract revisions and price changes. Renewal fees for the
            following term will be automatically invoiced to your account.
          </p>
          <li><h4 style="margin: 0">Failure to pay</h4></li>
          <ol type="a" style="margin-top: 0">
            <li>
              In the case of a web site hosted on a TACO hosting server, failure
              of Client to remit payment to TACO by the invoice due date is
              cause for removal of the Client's web site files from the TACO
              hosting server. Client agrees that TACO shall not be held liable
              for such removal or disconnection.
            </li>
            <li>
              In the case of a customer's colocated server, failure of a Client
              to remit payment to TACO by the invoice due date is cause for the
              server to be disconnected from the TACO network and unplugged
              without further notification by TACO. Client agrees that TACO
              shall not be held liable for such removal or disconnection.
              Disconnected customer owned equipment shall be returned to the
              customer only upon full payment of outstanding invoices, less any
              credits due based on our Refund Policy, below. TACO shall not be
              held responsible for such equipment when held in such
              disconnected/unplugged fashion for over sixty days, after which
              the equipment will be deemed to be abandoned by the customer.
