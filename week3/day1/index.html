    <h1>Small Exercise 3</h1>
    <p>This exercise is about making lists</p>
    <p>Here is what I like about making lists:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>They're useful for displaying lists of stuff</li>
      <li>That's about it</li>
      <li>I'm gonne put another list item</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When you make a list, do it in this order</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Decide if it's an ordered list or not</li>
      <li>
        If it's not an ordered list, use ul, if it is, use ol
        <ul>
          <li>
            Use li nested for your list items
            <ol>
              Curveball! You can nest lists inside each other
            </ol>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>You've got this, I believe in you!</li>
    </ol>
