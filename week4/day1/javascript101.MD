# Javascript

- one of the best ways to debug javscript is console.log and print things at each part of logic
- console.log can print many many different things

- console.log will print parts/string, console.table will print objects/arrays

- table can get unweildy but it can be very useful

block scope will only live inside of the for loop body.

### use let instead of var to prevent errors of scope

cont also has a blocked scope. cannot print out const outside of for loop. const are immutable, they cannot change
