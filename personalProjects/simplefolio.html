          This is where I will put my projects. I plan to have them dynamic so
          they will start out 3 across then go downt to 2 then down to 1. I
          don't currently have time to do that because it is 11:45pm so here are
          some fun facts about me.
        </p>
        <p>
          I interned with the Navy Marine Mammal Program where I assisted in
          husbandry training for baby dolpins as well as training sea lions to
          search and mark underwater mines. I also helped with research projects
          on sonar with a blind dolphin.

      <div class="lower-content">
        <h2>
          This is the second column in the holy grail so I will put more info
          here as I do not know yet what to put
        </h2>
        <p>
          I have also completed the entire FBI interview process and passed the
          background check, however, due to a few factors, declined my contract
          to the training academy.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have run 15 half marathons and 2 full marathons. I placed 3rd in my
          age group in a 10k in college and placed 3rd in a beginning bouldering
          competiton 2 years ago. I have had gastric sleeve surgery around 3
          years ago and lost 90 pounds.
