# Github projects

similar to trello but better because it is linked to the direct code.

1. start using project table or make a board (board is a bit easier to look at)
2. Need to choose a project manager
3. Testing before done

### needs to have board on project managers repo

## ** will work on own branch **

merge code to main branch
convert to issue and attach to repo

markdown is supported on github projects
code is supported as well

add assignees (invite partner to repo)
should have a lot of user stories
break up into simple stories

pulling is a daily task

## do not edit code on github

## close issue when done

# Demo

1. Make new repo on github desktop
2. Add (Create new repo) (local on PM computer)
3. Name Repo and create repo
4. Publish Repo, do not make code private
5. Organization, None and hit Publish
6. Github.com to invite people, settings, collaborators
7. Add people by username
8. get information and repo down to your computer
9. add, clone by url -- you only need to initialize a project one time
10. one person creates and inits projects
11. --need to make a git ignore, at top level of project folder. add node modules
12. first commit is initial setup
13. github desktop, fetch origin, pull request
14. first thing you need to do when pulling is `npm i` (make sure you're in the right folder), needs to be where package.json file is
15. in github desktop, click current branch, new branch, fistname*lastname_feature, click create branch, bring my features, create branch, publish branch \_will always work on your own branch*!!!!!!!
    **can check in bottom left corner of VS Code to make sure you are working in your own branch**

## Fixing merge conflicts

Create pull requests means we are sending the branch code to the main code
Merge code with green checks means no conflicts with base(main) branch
Merge pull request on github.com, PM needs to confirm merge
On main branch, fetch, pull origin
**On VS Code source control, 3 dots, pull,push, pull from, origin/main**
Can fix the merge conflict on VS Code this way
Delete the redundancy and accept both, and save
Commit the merge and push origin

## DONT EDIT ON GITHUB
