# Github projects

similar to trello but better because it is linked to the direct code.

1. start using project table or make a board (board is a bit easier to look at)
2. Need to choose a project manager
3. Testing before done

### needs to have board on project managers repo

## ** will work on own branch **

merge code to main branch
convert to issue and attach to repo

markdown is supported on github projects
code is supported as well

add assignees (invite partner to repo)
should have a lot of user stories
break up into simple stories

pulling is a daily task

## do not edit code on github

## close issue when done
